# HRI-Internship-Project-25
This project explores Vision and Language-guided Real-time Emotional Text Generation to enhance human-robot interaction. By combining computer vision and natural language processing, robots can interpret visual and contextual cues, such as facial expressions and body gestures, to generate emotionally relevant text responses in real time.
